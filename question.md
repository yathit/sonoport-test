Sonoport technical test brief - 2015
------------------------------------------

This test is intended to demonstrate that you possess good proficiency in
the major required skills from the job-description for the FrontEnd developer
role at Sonoport. (And if you have no previous experience with the required WebAudio API http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/ to see how quickly you can pick it up)

The task is to create a simple web app (which works on mobile browsers) with the following functionality:

1) The app should animate the attached sprite sheet spritesheet.png to make the reindeer jump on the spot.
2) The app should load the audio file audio.wav and play the audio in a loop synchronised with the animation.
3) The audio file is not a perfect loop, but has some noise at the beginning, the noise should be skipped over during the looping.

Optional(for extra points): The app can adjust the speed of the animation and the audio based on movement of the mobile phone or device.

There is no time limit but obviously a fast turn-around will speak in your
favour.

You may host your app on static hosting service like Github Pages, and/or zip up the source with instructions to run it.

You will be scored largely on best-practices such as robustness, re-usability,
extensibility, cross browser compatibility, mobile browser support, pragmatism, etc.
